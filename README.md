# Fullstack Nodejs/Vuejs DevCoach App

>

## PROJECT ARCHITECTURE

The development of this Fullstack APP took into account several specific needs. It is carefully crafted as one that can easily require updates and new features, taking into account the need for scalability, easy maintainance, performance and security. I have chosen to use the MODEL-VIEW CONTROLLER (MVC)
architecture.

## Usage

Rename "config/config.env.env" to "config/config.env" and update the values/settings to your own.

## Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Run App

```
# run in development
npm run dev

#run in production
npm start
```
